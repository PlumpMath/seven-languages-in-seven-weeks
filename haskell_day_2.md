# Find

1. Functions that you can use on lists, strings, or tuples.

2. A way to sort lists.

# Do

1. Write a sort that takes a list and returns a sorted list.

```Haskell
```

2. Write a sort that takes a list and a function that compares its two arguments
and then returns a sorted list.

```Haskell
```

3. Write a Haskell function to convert a string to a number. The string should
be in the form of `$2,345,678.99` and can possibly have leading zeros.

```Haskell
```

4. Write a function that takes an argument `x` and returns a lazy sequence that
has every third number, starting with `x`. Then, write a function that includes
every fifth number, beginning with `y`. Combine these functions through
composition to return every eighth number, beginning with `x + y`.

```Haskell
```

5. Use a partially applied function to define a function that will return half
of a number and another that will append `\n` to the end of any string.

```Haskell
```

6. Write a function to determine the greatest common denominator of two
integers.

```Haskell
```

7. Create a lazy sequence of prime numbers.

```Haskell
```

8. Break a long string into individual lines at proper word boundaries.

```Haskell
```

9. Add line numbers to the previous exercise.

```Haskell
```

10. To the above exercise, add functions to left, right, and fully justify the
text with spaces (making both margins straight).

```Haskell
```
