# Find

1. A few monad tutorials.

https://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Monad_tutorials_timeline

2. A list of the monads in Haskell.

https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/libraries/base/Control-Monad.html#t%3AMonad

# Do

1. Write a function that looks up a hash table value tht uses the `Maybe` monad.
Write a hash that stores other hashes, several levels deep. Use the `Maybe`
monad to retrieve an element for a hash key several levels deep.

```Haskell
```

2. Represent a maze in Haskell. You'll need a `Maze` type and a `Node` type, as
well as a function to return a node given its coordinates. The node should have
a list of exits to other nodes.

```Haskell
```

3. Use a List monad to solve the maze.

```Haskell
```

4. Implement a Monad in a nonfuncional language. (See the article series on
monads in Ruby)

```Haskell
```
